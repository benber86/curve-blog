# Sandwich Attacks are Zero Sum Games

Sandwiches are widely considered to be detrimental because they create a financial loss for the sandwiched victims.
Sandwiches are zero sum games, in which **any profit made by the attacker comes from an equivalent loss incurred by the victim**.

During a sandwich, the value in a constant function automated market maker (CFAMM) will remain, by definition, constant (or will increase slightly if fees are applied). 
A searcher will, at least in theory, only execute a sandwich attack if it is profitable to do so. 
They therefore likewise end up with more value than they started with at the end of the transaction.
While they must pay fees to the AMM during the front and back-run transactions, this is compensated by the value they extract during the sandwich.
This leaves the victim has the only dependent variable, which must incur a loss to pay for the fees and the attacker's profit.

We can illustrate this with the common scenario in which a liquidity taker attacks another taker on a CFAMM. 
We'll ignore AMM fees and gas costs for simplicity's sake. 
The CFAMM is defined by its constant function $f(x, y) = k$ where x and y are the quantities of two tokens in the pool, and k is a constant.
Prior to any transactions in our scenario, the AMM's initial state is $(x_0, y_0)$.
The Victim ($V$) intends to sell $x$ tokens ($\Delta x$) in order to buy $y$ tokens ($\Delta y$).

Knowing that the expected price (including price impact) at the time of sending the trader order may not be the actual execution price, the Victim sets a slippage tolerance $s$, such that the transaction will revert if the amount of $y$ token received is less than $(1-s)\Delta y$.
This also means that the Victim will most likely not receive their expected $\Delta y$ but instead will get $\Delta y'$ - due to the pool's state changing from other trades (including adversarial ones) executing prior to the Victim's trade.

To perform a sandwich attack, the Attacker ($A$) will need two transactions.
The goal of the first transaction (front-run) is to manipulate the price of the pool's assets by buying a large quantity $\delta y$ of $y$ asset with $\delta x$ tokens, so that buying $y$ tokens becomes more expensive for the Victim.
After the front-run and the Victim's trade have been executed, the Attacker sells back the entirety of their $y$ tokens ($\delta y$) and receives $\delta x'$ tokens in return (back-run).
Their profit is the difference between their amount of $x$ tokens after the sandwich ($\delta x'$) and their original amount ($\delta x$)

A bit more formally:

- **Front-run**: $(x_0, y_0) \longrightarrow (x_1, y_1)$ where $(x_1, y_1) = (x_0 + \delta x, y_0 - \delta y)$
- **Victim trade**: $(x_1, y_1) \longrightarrow (x_2, y_2)$ where $(x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + \Delta x, y_1 - \Delta y')$
- **Back-run**: $(x_2, y_2) \longrightarrow (x_3, y_3)$ where $(x_3, y_3) = (x_2 - \delta x', y_2 + \delta y)$

And the Attacker's profit is $\Pi_A = \delta x' - \delta x$  

We also have different prices at each steps (expressing the price of $y$ in units of $x$):
- **Initial price**: $P_0 = y_0 / x_0$
- **Front-run price**: $P_1 = \delta y / \delta x = (y_0 - y_1) / (x_1 - x_0)$
- **Victim price**: $P_2 = \Delta y' / \Delta x = (y_1 - y_2) / (x_2 - x_1)$
- **Back-run price**: $P_3 = \delta y / \delta x' = (y_3 - y_2) / (x_2 - x_3) $


We know that $\delta x = P_1 * \delta y$ and $\delta x' = P_3 * \delta y$. 
Since the attack would not be executed unless it was profitable we also know that $\Pi_A =  \delta x' - \delta x > 0$. We can conclude that $\delta x' > \delta x$ and therefore $P_3 > P_1$.

We plug in the values of $P_3$ and $P_1$ from above into this inequality to get:

$\frac{(y_3 - y_2)}{(x_2 - x_3)} > \frac{(y_0 - y_1)}{(x_1 - x_0)}$

We know that $(x_2 - x_3)$, $(x_1 - x_0)$ and $(y_0 - y_1)$ are all positive. 
In the back-run, the attacker is selling $y$ tokens to receive $x$ tokens, so $x_2 > x_3$.
In the front-run, the attacker is buying $y$ tokens by selling $x$ tokens, so $x_1 > x_0$, and $y_0 > y_1$.

We can therefore rewrite the inequality as:

$(x_2 - x_3) < \frac{(y_3 - y_2)(x_1 - x_0)}{(y_0 - y_1)}$

Since:

$\Pi_A = \delta x' - \delta x = (x_2 - x_3) - (x_1 - x_0)$

We have:

$\Pi_A < \frac{(y_3 - y_2)(x_1 - x_0)}{(y_0 - y_1)} - (x_1 - x_0)$

$\iff \Pi_A < (x_1 - x_0) \left[ \frac{(y_3 - y_2)}{(y_0 - y_1)} - 1 \right]$

$\iff \Pi_A < (x_1 - x_0) \left[ \frac{(y_1 - y_2) - (y_0 - y_3)}{(y_0 - y_1)} \right]$

We know that $(y_0 - y_3) \geq 0$. The Attacker returns as many $y$ tokens during the back-run as they took during the front-run, so only what the Victim bought is taken from the pool's $y$ balance after the sandwich: $y_3 = y_0 - \Delta y' \implies y_3 \leq  y_0 $ . 

Furthermore, $(y_1 - y_2) = \Delta y'$ and $\Delta y' \leq (1-s)\Delta y$, since the transaction would not be executed if the Victim's slippage limit were exceeded. Therefore:

$\Pi_A < \frac{(x_1 - x_0)}{(y_0 - y_1)}((1-s)\Delta y)$

Which shows that **the Attacker's profit is bounded by Victim's slippage tolerance and the price increase the Attacker can generate from the price impact of the front-run**. 
AMM fees and gas costs, if we were to account for them, would reduce the upper profit boundary but would not fundamentally alter the inequation.  
The above scenario makes no assumption about the nature of the AMM's constant function but confirms prior work by [Heimbach and Wattenhofer (2002)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03762) on Uniswap V2, in which the authors show that a sandwiching bot's profit cannot exceed the victimâ€™s loss in a constant product formula AMM ($xy = k$). 


# From Zero Sum Duels to Greater Fool Theory

It therefore appears from the above that a sandwich will always result in a financial loss for the victim.
But while the scenario described is very common and what most people picture when thinking of a sandwich attack, it does not cover all attack scenarios.
